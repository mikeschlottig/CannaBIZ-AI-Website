🌿 CannaBIZ AI: Commercial Product Roadmap (Q3 2025 - Q3 2026)
Product Vision: To become the indispensable, compliance-first AI platform that empowers cannabis businesses to grow revenue through intelligent automation and deep customer insights.

Guiding Principles:

Compliance-First: Every feature will be built with the complex regulatory landscape as a primary design constraint.

User-Centric Design: We will work directly with a cohort of pilot customers to ensure the product solves real-world pain points.

Agile & Iterative: We will build, measure, and learn in focused sprints, delivering value incrementally.

Scalable & Secure: The architecture will be designed for enterprise-grade reliability, security, and performance from day one.

Phase 1: Foundation & Core MVP (Closed Beta)
Timeline: August 2025 - October 2025 (3 Months)

Primary Goal: To build and deploy a stable, compliant, and valuable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a closed beta group of 5-10 cannabis retailers. The focus is on data ingestion, core CRM functionality, and foundational business intelligence.
